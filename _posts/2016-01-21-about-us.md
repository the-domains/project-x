## About Us

Project X is a Ghanaian vocational fashion and
textile manufacturing school focused on providing young women with high quality
educations and work opportunities. It is the brainchild of Gladys Murphy, a
Ghanaian clothing-manufacturing entrepreneur. Through partnerships with local
manufacturers such as Studio 189 and Liberty & Justice, Project X is able
to guarantee employment opportunities for its graduates while ensuring that
their training meets the needs of local businesses. Likewise, partners from the
UK will assist in the establishment of high quality training so that production
meets the highest international standards that will promote industry growth. Project
X aims to create a sustainable business model through both cross-subsidization
by which students who can afford to pay will be charged admission fees, and the
reinvestment of surpluses so that its transformative courses can be opened to
as many young women as possible through scholarships and bursaries. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/512d23cd-7f45-4f81-8f22-4b8451c4038f.jpg)
