## About Us

Project X is a Ghanaian vocational fashion and textile manufacturing school focused on providing young women with high quality educations and work opportunities. It is the brainchild of Gladys Murphy, a Ghanaian clothing-manufacturing entrepreneur. Through partnerships with local manufacturers such as Studio 189 and Liberty & Justice, Project X is able to guarantee employment opportunities for its graduates while ensuring that their training meets the needs of local businesses. Likewise, partners from the UK will assist in the establishment of high quality training so that production meets the highest international standards that will promote industry growth. Project X aims to create a sustainable business model through both cross-subsidization by which students who can afford to pay will be charged admission fees, and the reinvestment of surpluses so that its transformative courses can be opened to as many young women as possible through scholarships and bursaries.
