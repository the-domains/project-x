            <title><![CDATA[About Us]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About Us</h1><p>Project X is a Ghanaian vocational garment and textile manufacturing school focused on providing predominantly young women with high quality education and work opportunities, developing manufacturing standard and facilitating manufacturing job creation in West Africa. It is the brainchild of Gladys Murphy, a Ghanaian clothing-manufacturing entrepreneur. Through partnerships with local manufacturers such as Studio 189 and Liberty & Justice, Project X is able to guarantee employment opportunities for its graduates while ensuring that their training meets the needs of local businesses. Likewise, partners from the UK, including UAL/ Central St Martins will assist in the establishment of high quality training so that production meets the highest international standards that will promote industry growth. Project X aims to create a sustainable business model through both cross-subsidization by which manufacturers or students who can afford to pay will be charged course fee admission fees, and the reinvestment of surpluses support access for students that cannot afford to pay. This approach enables Project X's transformative courses to be opened-up to as many young women as possible through scholarships and bursaries.Â </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ed65d79dce989d2ab00889a9a2df12ff19839188.jpg"></article>]]></description>
